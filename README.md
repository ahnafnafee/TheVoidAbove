## **Name of Game**

The Void Above

## **Platform**

PC

## **Demographic**

The main demographic would be teens or adults who are looking for a balance of pretty visuals, an interesting story, and action.

## **Basic Game Concept**

You play as an intergalactic courier whose job is to deliver an important package to another part of the galaxy. The only issue is that there is a war going on and the player will have to endure warring forces and the dangers of space to complete their job.

## **Description of Key Mechanics**

The game has three main game mechanics: Flight mechanics, Gunplay, and Package mechanics. The player will fly their way throughout space, and they will be able to move in any direction. They do need to control their speed because crashing at high speeds will damage the player. Also, the game utilizes Gunplay in more than an offensive manner. You will be able to shoot obstacles and enemies, while also using guns to quickly propel yourself in a different direction. This can be used to evade fast moving obstacles or to gain speed and momentum. Then finally, there is the package mechanic. Due to the fact, that the game centers around this package, you need to make sure that it does not get lost or destroyed. Typically, it will be attached to the player, but different variables can separate the two, forcing the player to try and reclaim the package.

## **Unique Selling Points**

The game uses straightforward storytelling alongside beautiful aesthetics to create a fun and visually pleasing experience. It will also utilize these strong visuals to entertain the player even when they are out of combat. Aside from visuals, the gameplay would also be fast paced and energetic in a way that gives players a sense of agency and danger, while still working in tandem with visuals.

## **Comparable Games**

The Void Above was inspired by games like Journey and Abzu; they too are limited narrative adventure games that use unique art styles to maintain player interest. The Void Above also takes aspects from games like Anthem, Lawbreakers, Death Stranding, and even Shadow of the Colossus. The flying mechanic works very similarly to Anthem&#39;s third-person flight mechanics. The gun propulsion mechanic would function like how they did in LawBreakers, where the player could use the force of gunshots to move in low gravity. There is a package mechanic, which is similar to the one seen in Death Stranding. Finally, there is how action would be handled in certain situations. Shadow of the Colossus is a game that is very narrative focused while still allowing the player to fight in meaningful ways that don&#39;t detract from the main story. We plan on trying to find that balance in The Void Above so that people would be able to enjoy more than one particular aspect of the game.
