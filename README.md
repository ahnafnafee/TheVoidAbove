## Premise

In The Void Above you play as a courier who must deliver an important package in deep space during an intergalactic conflict. However, the path to your destination is a hard one since not only do you have to traverse through rubble from the nearby conflict, but enemies from the war are also trying to stop you from delivering the package and take it for themselves.

## Unique Selling Points

## Gameplay & Mechanics

- The primary method of travel are THRUSTERS; players navigate the expanse of space and carefully dodge debris and EVADE ENEMIES. TheirÂ speed is restricted in regard toÂ the thrusters,Â but there is a lot of control over direction when using them
- The player is also capable of QUICK DASHES to navigate levelsÂ and evade enemies or moving hazards, augmenting the amount of control they have over their movement
- Delivering the package is the PURPOSE of the game, but it's also loosely attached. If a player collides at a hard enough speed or is struck with enough force, it will detach. TheyÂ must retrieve it again and continue in order to exit the level
- Players are provided with helpful WAYPOINTS that will guide them to their next objective, if they are ever lost or confused, they can always rely on the waypoint to guide them.
- Players are equipped with a basic PISTOL.Â The enemies are also equipped and attack in a similar manner in an attempt to damage the player for going through their territory.
