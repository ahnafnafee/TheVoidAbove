### **1.**    **Game Summary**

*The Void Above* is a new exploration/adventure game from the developers, Void Gaming.

*The Void Above* is inspired by games like ABZ횤, Journey, where the gameplay focuses on the surrounding environment and how the player interacts with them, including the stunning visuals that will accompany it.

### **2.**    **Primary Game Mechanics/USP**

*The Void Above* gameplay can be broken down into four distinct gameplay categories:

- Aesthetically Beautiful Environment
- Reactive Gunplay
- Resource Collection
- Thrilling Story

 

### **3.**    **Setting/Story**

*The Void Above* occurs in a world where you play as an intergalactic courier whose job is to deliver an important package to another part of the galaxy. You work for the Intergalactic Postal Service (IPS for short) and it is your sworn duty to deliver it by any means possible. The only issue is that there is a war going on, and the player will have to endure warring forces and the dangers of space to complete their job. The two warring factions have been fighting for ages and now, they have arrived to fight over the current galaxy the game takes place in. One faction seeks to assimilate everything into its robotic hive mind, while the other wants to conquer planets for resources.



We intend to tell a story of a galaxy, as the character moves through debris and fights their way through enemy hordes. The player will fly their way throughout space, and they will be able to move in any direction. They do need to control their speed because crashing at high speeds will damage the player.



### **4.**    **Art Style Summary**

The art in *The Void Above* will be inspired by games like Journey and ABZ횤, where the art style is simplistic but has an aesthetic color palette that blends the narrative and gameplay. Characters will be humanoids, while the weapons will be futuristic with sci-fi elements. The primary environment will be space so it will have god rays passing through from surrounding debris and floating battle stations. Enemies like drones will have an alien-and-evil feel to them.

We plan to have more detailed art soon - the main environment references from games like ABZ횤 and Journey. We also created an initial concept environment too below.
